### Project Description

This website showcases a variety of dynamic routing protocols used in computer networks. It features an attractive and modern design that includes articles describing each protocol and relevant images. The structure of the pages is organized in a card format, making it easier to search for information. Each card contains a title, a brief description of the protocol, and a link to read more, facilitating access to additional content.

#### Structure and Design

The website is organized in **cards**, each representing a specific routing protocol. This not only makes it easier to visualize the information but also simplifies navigation by allowing users to click on the cards to explore further details. Each card contains:

- **Protocol Title**: A clear heading that identifies the routing protocol.
- **Brief Description**: A short summary explaining the function and features of the protocol, helping any user quickly understand its purpose and application.
- **Representative Image**: A visual image included alongside the description, which helps contextualize the information and makes it more engaging.
- **Link to More Information**: Each card has a link that leads to additional resources, allowing any user to research the topic if they want more information.

#### Technologies Used

The page is built using **HTML** for the basic structure, **CSS** for styling and visual design, and it relies on responsive design to ensure that the interface is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. Other **CSS** features enable a dynamic layout of the elements on the page.

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the page and organizes the content semantically.
- **CSS**: Utilizes custom color and style variables, making it easier to manage and maintain the visual design.
